### Display Solution

## Accessing the web page

# The URL for the monitor should be as follows: http://{Server}/DisplaySolution.php
# Please refresh the web page once you've replaced the images. 

## Adding Images

# Any image placed in this folder with an extension of ".jpg" will be cycled through the monitor
# Images must be a ".jpg" file type or else it will not be picked up by the script.
# The naming scheme for the images will be an incremental number in order to control the sequence of the images.
# ex. 1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg....10.jpg, etc. 
# Failure to incorrectly name the files as the examples on the line above, will cause the script not to work.
