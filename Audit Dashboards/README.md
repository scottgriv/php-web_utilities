Connects to database tables to display record counts and create threshold alerts.

## Author
Developed by Scott Grivner.

## Version Release and Date
v1.0 - 03/22/17

### Getting Started
Adjust the Audit_Dashboard.php and html files to flip through multiple dashboards.
Specify your database connection and queries in the php file.
I strongly recommend including WHERE and LIMIT clauses to minimize the result set loading times.
