# Audit Dashboards
Connects to database tables in order to display record counts and create threshold alerts.

## Getting Started
Adjust the Audit_Dashboard.php and html files to flip through multiple dashboards.

## Deployment
Specify your database connection and queries in the php file.
I strongly recommend including WHERE and LIMIT clauses to minimize the result set loading times.
